# Pygame [Examples](https://github.com/pygame-examples/pygame-examples/tree/main/pgex/examples)
Just a bunch of [pygame](https://github.com/pygame-community/pygame-ce) examples, feel free to use them

Most examples should be WASM compatible meaning that they can be run in the browser (after being properly packaged)


# Installation 
## By cloning the repository 
  - We recommend reading our [getting a development environment setup](https://github.com/pygame-examples/pygame-examples/blob/main/SETUP.md)
## Through pip
  - `pip install git+https://github.com/pygame-examples/pygame-examples`
## Through [releases](https://github.com/pygame-examples/pygame-examples/releases)
  - Coming soon.

# Usage
  - These are primarily meant to be used to read the source code, so going through our [examples](https://github.com/pygame-examples/pygame-examples/tree/main/pgex/examples) should allow you to get an idea on how we recommend writing your code.
  - Our examples are also compatible with WASM builds, follow conventions, have been reviewed by experienced pygame users, and follow an [ECS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system) or [OOP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) paradigm (for the most part). Which means that following our example (no pun intended), should help you to write *better* Python code with the `pygame` framework!
  - If you want to try running our examples, and want to avoid the tedious process of setting up a development environment, we recommend using `pip install git+https://github.com/pygame-examples/pygame-examples` if you have Python `3.7+` installed. This will also add `pgex` to the PATH.
  - You can use the `pgex` CLI interface to get started with launching examples on desktop or browser:
  - You can start by running `pgex --help` which should list the available commands. 
	  - `pgex run` can be used to run any of the available examples
	    `pgex run -n "example_name"` can be used to directly run the given example
	    `pgex run --web` can be used to run the example on the browser. All examples are WASM compatible.
	  - `pgex view` can be used to view the main file for the example on [github.com](https://github.com/Matiiss/pygame_examples)
	    `pgex view -n "example_name"` can be used to run a specific example.
